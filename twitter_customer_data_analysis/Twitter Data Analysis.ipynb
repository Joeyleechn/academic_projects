    "Case1: The \"highest percentage\" refers to countries that account for the highest percentages in all mobile-login users with food as their hashtag. For example, if Japan has 8 users and Morocco has 2 users, the two countries would take up 80% and 20% respectively. \n",
    "The business value of this case is that we could know which countries have the most users tagging “food”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case2：The \"highest percentage\" refers to the percentage calculated by dividing (food-tagged users and mobile-login users) with (mobile-login users). For example, if Japan has 10 mobile login users and among them 86 have tagged “food”, then the percentage of Japan is 60%. Compare the percentage of each country and retrieve the top 5 ones. \n",
    "The business meaning of this case is that we could know which countries have the highest percentages of foodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both cases have the same beginning step that the Users table left joins the Tweets table, with whether user IDs are mobile-login users in the Logins table as the screening criterion. Joined_table is created as the source table for the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For case1, keep data with “food” as its hashtag and count the number of distinct users for each country group by country. Then use a window function to calculate the percentage each country takes on and retrieve the top 5 ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For csae2, derive two tables for the numerator(up) and the denominator(down). Since the denominator would not be empty if a country has mobile-login users and does not have food-tagged users, use the denominator part to left join the numerator by country name and calculate the percentage. Sort the result by percentage descendingly and retrieve the top 5 ones."
